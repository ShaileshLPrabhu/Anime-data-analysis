This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing information about the top 250 anime. The dataset is assumed to be in CSV format and includes various details about each anime such as its score, popularity, members, genre, and type.

The project is divided into several stages:

Data Importing: The project begins by importing necessary Python libraries and loading the anime data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame.

Data Exploration: The DataFrame is then explored to get a sense of the data. This includes displaying the first few rows of the DataFrame, checking the data types of each column, and getting a statistical summary of the numerical columns.

Data Cleaning: The data is cleaned by checking for and handling missing values and duplicate entries. Certain columns that are not needed for the analysis are dropped.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various analyses are performed on the cleaned data. These include finding and visualizing the top-rated, most popular, and most viewed anime; calculating and visualizing the average score, popularity, and viewership for each genre and type of content.
